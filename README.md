# final-interview-term-1

The final part of the final for term 1 for me was palandrome problem where I needed to solve a word that could be backwards equal to original string passed in a function. So my missions initially was just to write a function for that , where increasingly difficult optimizations was asked of me. Then I needed to identify what palandrome was with example like madam and aabbcaba and how the pattern for it is identifiable where we needed an odd number of characters with the same characters on both sides of matching a palandrome specifications.
